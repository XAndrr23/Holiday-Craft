# Holiday Craft

A short description of what this resource pack does:

## Minecraft Version
- Minecraft Bedrock Edition
- Tested on: 1.21.131+

## Features
- Custom christmas textures
- Converted from old MCPE alpha textures(specifically 0.10.0 I think)

## Installation
1. Download the mcpack
2. Install it in MCPE
3. Enable the pack in **Settings → Global Resources** or in any world you like!

## Notes
- Uses modern Bedrock texture names
- Grass block uses `grass_block_top`, `grass_block_side`, and `grass_carried` (there are a few glitches with the grass)
- No biome tinting on sides (by design)
- Any other items may be not renamed in order to the new game id textures(not sure)
